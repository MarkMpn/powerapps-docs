# Configure the Return to the Workplace solution

This article provides step-by-step instructions to IT administrators for configuring the Return to the Workplace solution. IT administrators are responsible for making sure the facility manager can guide their facilities throughout the phases. The following steps will be covered in this article:

- [Plan reopening phases](#plan-reopening-phases)

- [Manage facilities](#manage-facilities)

- [Specify solution settings](#specify-solution-settings)

## Prerequisites

The environment needs to have all Return to the Workplace components in place with the model-driven apps, canvas apps, and Power BI dashboards.

## Plan reopening phases

Reopening workplaces safely requires planning in phases to ensure the safety of the employees. Within these phases, you need to define goals, metrics, and readiness factors.

In the model-driven app, you select the **Solution Setup** module, which allows you to configure the plan.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Phase planning](media/solution-admin-new-setting-phase-planning.png "Phase planning")

**To define a reopen phase**

1. [Define key metrics](#define-key-metrics).

2. [Set up readiness categories](#set-up-readiness-categories).

3. [Define readiness factors](#define-readiness-factors).

4. [Set up a reopen phase](#set-up-a-reopen-phase).

5. [Set the goals and readiness factors for a phase](#set-the-goals-and-readiness-factors-for-a-phase).

## Define key metrics

By default, the solution provides and tracks five key metrics. You can define more metrics if you want. 

**To create a new key metric**

1. Select **Key Metrics** in the left pane, and then select **New**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Create key metrics](media/solution-admin-key-metrics.png "Create key metrics")

2. Enter a meaningful name for the metric.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Key metric form](media/solution-admin-new-key-metric-form.png "Key metric form")

3. Select **Save & Close**. The newly created record is available in the **Active Key Metrics** view.

To edit the record, select it, update the values, and then select **Save & Close**.

## Set up readiness categories

Readiness categories organize the readiness factors. By default, six categories are defined. 

**To create a new readiness category**

1. Select **Readiness Categories** in the left pane, and then select **New**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Readiness categories](media/solution-admin-new-readiness-category.png "Readiness categories")

   > ![Readiness category form](media/solution-admin-new-readiness-category-form.png "Readiness category form")

3. Select **Save & Close**. The newly created record is available in the **Active Categories** view.

To edit the record, select it, update the values, and then select **Save & Close**.

## Define readiness factors 

Readiness factors are used to determine whether the workplaces can move through phases. Some readiness factors are defined in the solution by default.

**To create a new readiness factor**

1. Select **Readiness Factors** in the left pane, and then select **New**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

   > ![Add readiness factors](media/solution-admin-reopen-phase-add-factors.png "Add readiness factors")

## Manage facilities

Facilities are an important part of the Return to the Workplace solution. By default, the solution includes two facility types&mdash;buildings and conference centers. The IT administrator is responsible for creating, updating the existing facility types, and importing records. 

**To manage facilities**

1. [Define facility types](#define-facility-types).

2. [Import facilities](#import-facilities).

## Define facility types

By default, two facility types are provided as an example.

**To create a new facility type**

1. Select **Facility Types** in the left pane, and then select **New**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Facility type](media/solution-admin-new-facility-type.png "facility type")

2. Enter appropriate values in the fields:

   | **Column**   | **Description**                     |
   |-------------|-------------------------------------|
   | Type        | Enter a name for the type of facility.    |
   | Description | Enter the description for the facility type. |

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Facility type form](media/solution-admin-new-facility-type-form.png "Facility type form")

3. Select **Save & Close**. The newly created record is available in the **Active Facility Types** view.

To edit the record, select it, update the values, and then select **Save & Close**.

## Import facilities

The facility sample data file is available in the package. When you want to import your own facilities, you can [download a template to use for data import](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/download-template-data-import).

**To import sample facility data to the Facility table**

1. On the left pane, under **Facility Management**, select **Facilities**.

2. Select **Import from Excel**, and select the facilities data file.
 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Import data](media/solution-admin-facilities-excel-import.png "Import data")

3. After the sample data is imported, you'll see the imported records in the table.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Active facilities](media/solution-admin-facilities-active.png "Active facilities")

## Specify solution settings

The overall solution requires certain configurations to ensure that the user has the correct information. You can use solution settings to configure your own terms of agreement, health terms of agreement, and contact email. You can also use themes to tailor the experience to your company branding.

When setting up the solution, do the following:

1. [Set solution settings](#set-solution-settings).

2. [Define a theme](#define-a-theme).

## Set solution settings

With solution settings, you define system settings unique to your company. Solution settings are linked to a facility group or to the entire organization, which makes it possible to differentiate them for facilities in that group. One solution setting will act as the default and will be applicable for every facility, which will be the solution setting record that has an empty facility group.

Some of these settings have an impact on the Employee app. The solution setting record that applies is found by matching the facility group of that user's default facility to settings. If no record is found or the user has no default facility set, the default solution settings record is used.

**To set solution settings**

1. Select **Solution Settings** in the left pane, and then select **New**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Solution Settings](media/solution-admin-view-solution-settings.png)

2. Enter the appropriate values in the fields.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Solution settings form](media/solution-admin-new-setting.png "Solution settings form")

   
   | **Column**              | **Description**                                |
   |------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
   | Name | Name of the solution settings record. |
   | Facility Group | Applicable facility group, leave empty for default. |
   | Company Name |Name of the company for solution settings. |
   | Allow Employee Sentiment | Capture employee sentiment information in the Employee app. |
   | Allow storing of Negative Attestations | When disabled, negative attestations registered in the Employee app are not stored. |
   | Allow QR codes | Enables QR code on the pass in the Employee app and Employee portal.  |
   | Allow Guest Registrations | Enables employees to register guests on their bookings in the Employee app.  |
   | Allow Share Guest Registrations | Enables employees to share passes with guests. |
   | Health & Safety email | Email address shown when the employee doesn't attest to Health & Safety Instructions in the Employee app.   |
   | Health & Safety Instructions | General instructions provided to employee in the Employee app when access is blocked by the case manager. |
   | General Terms & Agreement | Shown in the Employee app during the booking process. |
   | Health Terms & Agreement | Shown in the Employee app during the booking process. |
   |||

3. On the **Guest** tab, add values for the guest-related settings.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Solution settings guest tab](media/solution-admin-guest-setting.png "Solution settings guest tab")

   | **Column**              | **Description**                                |
   |------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
   | Guest Health Terms & Agreement | Shown in the Employee app during the guest registration process.|
   | Guest Privacy Terms & Agreement | Shown in the Employee app during the guest registration process. |
   | Allow Unauthenticated Guests to Create a Pass (Portal only) | Enable unauthenticated guests to create a pass. |
   | Allow on behalf of attestations (Portal only) | Allow attestation on behalf a guest. |
   | Resource Text (Portal only) | Information around the resource. |
   |||

## Set duplicate detection rules for employee cases

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).

2. Select the environment in which the app is located.

3. On the command box, select **Settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Environment Settings](media/solution-environmnet-setting.png "Environment Settings")

4. Expand **Data management** and then select **Duplicate detection rules**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Data Management](media/solution-data-management.png "Data Management")

5. Select **New** and enter the appropriate values in the fields. 

   | **Column**   | **Description**                     |

   | Base Record Type | Select Employee Case. |
   | Matching Record Type | Select Employee Case. |
   | Field | Select Employee. |
   | Criteria | Select Exact Match. |

   Select the **Exclude inactive matching records** check box.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Pop up](media/solution-pop-up-rule.png "Pop up")

6. Select **Save and Close**.

7. Select the newly created rule from the list of rules and then select **Publish**.

## Define a theme

You can use a theme to enhance the user experience.

1. Select **Settings**, and then select **Customizations**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Settings](media/solution-admin-settings-themes.png "Settings")

2. Under Customizations, select **Themes**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Themes](media/solution-admin-settings.png "Themes")

3. From the list, select the default theme.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![All themes](media/solution-admin-settings-all-themes.png "All themes")

4. You can select different colors from the theme.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Theme color](media/deploy-theme-colors.png "Theme color")
   
## Bulk record deletion

Due to privacy regulations, we strongly recommend that you create bulk record-delete jobs to delete personal data after a certain period. Also, to reduce storage, you can delete deactivated share guest registrations or employee attestations after a certain period of time.

**To create bulk record-delete jobs**

1.	Select **Settings**, and then select **Data Management**

2.	Under **Data Management**, select **Bulk Record Deletion**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Data Management admin](media/solution-admin-dm.png "Data Management admin")

3.	Select **New**.

4.	Go through the **Bulk Deletion Wizard**.

5.	Select the appropriate **table** and **criteria**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Criteria](media/solution-admin-criteria.png "Criteria")

6.	Add a name and a schedule for the bulk record-delete job to run.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Bulk record delete job](media/solution-admin-brd.png "Bulk record delete job")

7.	Submit the bulk record-delete job.
