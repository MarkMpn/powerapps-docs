# Use the Employee Return to the Workplace app

This article provides step-by-step instructions about how to use the Employee Return to the Workplace app. You can check in, answer questions to determine whether you're eligible to enter a facility, and say how you feel about returning to the workplace.

## Prerequisites

- Open [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) in a web browser or download [Power Apps Mobile](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/downloads):

  - For Apple devices with iOS, such as iPhone and iPad, use the [App Store](https://aka.ms/powerappsios).

  - For Android devices, use [Google Play](https://aka.ms/powerappsandroid).

- Ensure that your organization has deployed and configured the Employee Return to the Workplace app, as described in [Deploy the solution](deploy.md).

## Get started with the app

Open the app from your device and sign in with your company's Azure Active Directory account. You can view all apps shared by your organization after you sign in. More information: [Power Apps mobile device sign in](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/run-app-client#open-power-apps-and-sign-in), [Power Apps web browser sign in](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/run-app-browser)

When you successfully sign in and open the **Return to the Workplace** app, you can get a day pass, look up facility status, or answer the employee sentiment question.

> ![Welcome screen](media/employee-welcome2.png "Welcome screen")

## See the reopen status of a facility

You can find all available facilities and see their reopen status. Select **Look Up Status** to look for facilities and view details such as whether the facility is open and what phase of reopening it's in.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![List of facilities](media/employee-facility-list2.png "List of facilities")

When you select a facility from the facility list, the current status of the facility and associated details are displayed. You can also book a space directly from the **LOOK UP STATUS** screen. When a facility isn't available, the **BOOK A SPACE** button is disabled. Select **<** to return to the previous screen.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Facility details](media/employee-facility-details2.png "Facility details")

## Check in to a facility

After you complete the steps to select a particular facility that's open to employees returning to work, you can complete a health survey that determines whether you're eligible to check in to that facility. 

If you're eligible, you'll be given a pass to your selected building for that day. 

**To check in to a facility**

1. Select **GET DAY PASS**.

2. Select an available facility from the facility list or select from the **Saved** facility shortcut if applicable. In the **Recent** section, you'll find the facilities you most recently used. The **Saved facilities** and the **Recent facilities** section show the available facilities based on their phase and the earlier bookings. When a facility isn't available, the two sections get disabled when a booking isn't available.

3. Select **BOOK A SPACE** to continue with the check-in process.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select facility](media/employee-select-facility.png "Select facility")

4. Select an available area within that facility. Select **See All Available** to show the available areas. Select **Save as default for future check ins** to save the area to reuse on future check-ins. Select **NEXT** to continue with the check-in process.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select area](media/employee-select-area.png "Select area")
   
    > [!NOTE]
    > When a facility has no available areas to reserve, the area booking screen is skipped for the user. The pass is generated only for that facility and not the area.

5. Select a time window for arrival at the facility. Select **NEXT** to continue with the check-in process.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Time](media/employee-select-time.png "Select time")

   > [!NOTE]
   > For a facility, you can indicate a time window in which people can check inâ€”30 minutes, 1 hour, or none. When the time window is not filled or is none, this screen will be skipped.

6. Accept the terms and agreements.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Terms and agreements](media/employee-termandagreement.png "Terms and agreements")

7. Review the list of symptom check statements. Select **I AGREE** if you agree with the statements, and **I DISAGREE** if you don't.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Symptom check](media/employee-agreement.png "Symptom check")

### Employee pass

If your responses to the symptom check statements show that you're healthy, you'll receive a pass to enter the selected facility. The pass is valid until the end of the day. If you create a pass for a facility for which you already created a pass earlier that day, the earlier pass will be canceled automatically. 

> [!NOTE]
> An administrator can disable the use of QR codes in the solution settings. This applies to both employee and guest passes.

If the administrator enabled QR codes in the solution settings, a QR code will be displayed on the pass (default). You can select the QR code to expand for easy scanning.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Employee pass](media/employee-pass.png "Employee pass")

To cancel your pass, select **CANCEL PASS**. Select **YES, CANCEL** to proceed with canceling the pass or **NO** to keep the pass.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Employee cancel pass](media/employee-cancel-pass.png "Employee cancel pass")

If your responses show you aren't healthy, you won't receive a pass. You'll be provided with contact information for the company health and safety department.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Not feeling well](media/employee-pass-negative.png "Not feeling well")

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, negative attestations are also stored in the solution settings. You can turn off this option if you don't want to store them.

## Create a guest pass

After an employee creates a pass, the **REGISTER A GUEST** option becomes available. If the employee does not have a valid pass, the **REGISTER A GUEST** option is disabled. An employee can create multiple guest passes.

> [!NOTE]
> In the solution settings, an administrator can disable the **REGISTER A GUEST** option. This removes the option from the screen as well.

To create a guest pass:

1. Create a pass for yourself as described in the previous section.
1. Select **REGISTER A GUEST**.
1. If a user has registered a guest before, five recent guest names are displayed. Select one of the recent guests or enter new guest details. To register a new guest, enter the details in the fields:

   |Field|Description|
   |------|----------|
   |Guest First Name| Enter the first name of the guest.|
   |Guest Last Name| Enter the last name of the guest.|
   |Company| Enter the company name of the guest.|
   |Email Address|Enter the email address of the guest.|
   |Phone Number|Enter the phone number of the guest.|

1. Select **NEXT** after you have entered all the details in the required fields.
1. The **Review Disclosure and Instructions** screen shows information about privacy disclosures, health requirements, and instructions for the guests. Both fields can be expanded with the **+** icon. Select **NEXT** to see the generated guest pass with details.
1. Select the **X** icon to return to the home page.

You can also access guest passes from the home screen by selecting the **PASS** icon at the top of the screen. Both the employee and guest passes can be seen on the screen. You can also share the guest passes by selecting the **SHARE PASS** button available on the guest pass.

### Email guest pass

When a guest pass is created, you can share the pass with the guest through email by selecting the **SHARE PASS** button available on the guest pass. This sends the guest an email with the host name, facility, date, and hour of the reservation with a QR code. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Share guest pass](media/employee-share-pass-email.png "Share guest pass")

> [!NOTE]
> In the solution settings, you can turn off the option to send email if you don't want to email guest passes.

## Share sentiment

You can say how you're feeling about returning to the workplace. On the home page, select one of the options to answer the question **Do you feel safe returning to work?**

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Share sentiment](media/employee-share-sentiment2.png "Share sentiment")

 This option will reset itself after you reopen the app.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Share sentiment reset](media/employee-share-sentiment2-2.png "Share sentiment reset")

> [!NOTE]
> In the solution settings, you can turn this feature off if you don't want to use this.

## Notifications

Employees will receive notifications via the Employee app. You can find the notification icon displayed on the top-right corner. If there are any unread notifications, a badge will be displayed showing the number of unread notifications. Selecting the notification icon navigates the employee to a new screen where all the notifications are displayed. The newest notifications are shown on top of the list.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Notification bell](media/employee-notification-bell.png "Notification bell")

A notification contains a created date, type, header text and a body. There are three types of notifications: **Information**, **Warning**, and **Error**. Each notification type can be identified by the icon next to the header text. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Notifications list](media/employee-notification-list.png "Notifications list")

A notification is marked as read when the notification is seen by the employee in the app. All the notifications that are read will be still shown in the notification screen. Employee can return to the main screen by selecting the **X** icon on the top-right of the screen.

## Facility access not available

Case manager or facility manager can block the employees from making bookings to a specific facility, which makes the employees unable to reserve the facility. You'll see a banner appearing on the home screen, indicating **Access is not available**. An error notification will be received with further instructions.

When an employee is blocked, the health and safety instructions are shown on the bottom of the notifications screen.

> [!NOTE]
> The health and safety instructions can be configured in the solution settings.
