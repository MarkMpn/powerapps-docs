# Manage portals from the Power Platform admin center

You can now manage portals in the Power Platform admin center. The Power Platform admin center helps you manage both capacity-based and add-on portals. You can also see information such as how many days are left before a trial portal expires. For more information about portal licensing, see the [licensing FAQ](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#portals) and [portal differences](../faq.md#what-is-the-difference-between-power-apps-portals-dynamics-365-portals-and-add-on-portals). For more information about Power Platform admin center, go to [Administer Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation).

Manage portals in the Power Platform admin center in two ways: Manage all portals for the current tenant from **Resources** > **Portals**. Or, manage portals for a specific environment from **Environments**.

## Manage all portals for a tenant
